<em> “Rainer Ganahl (born October 18, 1961, in Bludenz) is an Austrian-American conceptual artist who lives and works in New York. His work has been widely exhibited, including the Kunsthaus Bregenz, Austria; The Wallach Art Gallery, Columbia University, New York; the Gesellschaft für Aktuelle Kunst, Bremen, Germany; and the 48th Venice Biennale” </em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainer_Ganahl" target="_blank"> –Wikipedia </a> <br> </br> 

<div class="text">

While I was on spring break I got a text from “rainer.” The message was written in broken English and I had never heard of a Rainer before so I thought it was spam at first.

<br> </br>

“Rainer who?” I asked. <br> </br> I got a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainer_Ganahl" target="_blank">Wikipedia article</a> in reply. The article spoke of a three-time Venice Biennale artist who had his own exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art. After I read those first few impressive sentences of that article I really thought it was spam. 

<br> </br>

Then my phone rang. It was Rainer. He had a really thick German accent and he sounded like he was spitting into the phone as he spoke. He would cut you off before you asked how he got your number or where he was from or why he was calling you in the first place. And he yelled everything. I didn’t understand much of what he said during that first phone call but I did understand that he wasn’t kidding about being the guy from Wikipedia.

<br> </br>

When I flew back to Brooklyn to start my <a href="site/html/mickalene-thomas-internship.html" target="_blank">internship</a> I decided to go to his house. My parents always told me about stranger danger but I thought meeting Rainer Ganahl was worth the risk. 

<br> </br>

I met a short man in a stained tank top outside a crusty apartment in East Harlem. He had wrinkled skin and crooked teeth and shaggy hair. He looked very different from the image I saw on Wikipedia. But he was very friendly. I went to shake his hand but instead he threw his arms around me. He smelled like onions.

<br> </br>

Then we went inside. We walked down the stairs to the basement where he lived. It was a disaster. There were empty chip bags, flies, soggy boxes, roaches, carpet stains, puddles, dried food, dust, dirt, bottles of piss, and shit smears. I guess this is how artists live. Rainer offered me some pasta from the pan on the ground. I said no thanks. He insisted I eat it so I ate it. It wasn’t bad.

<br> </br>

Then he asked if I was an exhibition designer. I said yes. That was a fat lie. Sorry Rainer. Then he emailed me images of around 400 of his paintings and told me that the name of the show would be <em>If the Price is Right</em>. Kind of like the game show.

<br> </br>

“Other than that you have carte blanche,” he spat.

<br> </br>

Then he grabbed my arm and pulled me toward the door and eased me up the stairs and out of the dirty basement. We hugged once more and I got a mouthful of that onion smell again and I headed to the train station.

<br> </br>

That evening I looked through all 400ish of his paintings. I thought they were really weird at first. They were like news articles and Basquiat and protest posters all in one. I didn’t know what Rainer was going for with almost any of these but they all very laughed at American culture. Every one of his paintings made some sort of dig at captialism by drawing charicatures of Trump or recreating corporate logos or straight-up calling his fashion line <em>Comme des Marxists</em>.  I think it takes a European to do that. Even if I didn’t understand Rainer, I did understand his love for criticizing Americanism.

<br> </br>

That gave me the idea. What’s more capitalist, corporate, and American than the New York Stock Exchange? It went well with the name<em> If the Price Is Right</em> too since the NYSE’s entire focus is price. 

<br> </br>

So I got to work making initial sketches that night. I found a free font online called “LED Counter 7” where every glyph was made of dots just like LED stock market charts. It looked great in the green, red, and white colors you’d see on the screens in the trading floor.

<br> </br>

Next, I gathered a handful of recognizable financial logos like Mastercard and Visa and ICE. I fucked around in Adobe Illustrator until I made a giant mess of fake stock graphs, knockoff logos, and message animations in that dotted font. Rainer’s work satirizes consumerism by using its own elements, and so I thought it would be a good idea to do so even if he didn’t end up liking it. I made some silly logos and went back to his basement. More onion smell. I opened my laptop and he spat all over it with a “Great!” in a super thick German accent. I was relieved that he liked it. He said it was satirical just like he is. Nothing to see here.
