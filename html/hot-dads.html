            I'm a horny motherfucker. To know me is to know that I love nothing more than a hot, beefy daddy holding me tight. That's what was on my mind when Pamela Hovland assigned the infamous <em>New York Times</em> assignment in <em>Art 368: Graphic Design Methodologies</em> at Yale. The job? To cut up the front page of today's <em>New York Times</em> issue and turn it into a 10-page fanzine. That's it. Those were the only rules. I remember when she went around the room with a full stack of copies and plopped one onto my desk – the first thing that caught my eye was a giant, blond, stocky policeman in this sexy police harness and biker-esque sunglasses. I don't think I remember anything besides that hot dad from the rest of the class period. That policeman turned me the fuck on, and if I had carte blanche for that assignment, I was gonna use it. I decided to transform it into a magazine about Hot Dads. I was really fucking horny when we did that.
