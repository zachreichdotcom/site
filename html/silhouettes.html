            In my Art 368 Class, we were tasked with creating our own Zines out of the collection of nearly 100 images that we had collected throughout the semester. I decided to collect images of black objects, whose silhouettes were magnificent. I put them on transparent paper and bound them in plexiglass held together by two bolts.
