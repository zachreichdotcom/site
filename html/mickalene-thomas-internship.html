        <h1>Mickalene Thomas Internship</h1>
	<p>
	<em> “Mickalene Thomas (born January 28, 1971) is a contemporary African-American visual artist best known as a painter of complex works using rhinestones, acrylic, and enamel. Thomas's collage work is inspired from popular art histories and movements, including Impressionism, Cubism, Dada, the Harlem Renaissance, and selected works by the Afro-British painter Chris Ofili. Her work draws from Western art history, pop art, and visual culture to examine ideas around femininity, beauty, race, sexuality, and gender.” </em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickalene_Thomas" target="_blank"> –Wikipedia </a> <br> </br> 

            I'm working under an NDA so I can't say much. I'm learning a whole lot. I fucking love Mickalene.
